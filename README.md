# LAYOFFS 2022 MYSQL DATA CLEANING
Layoffs Data Cleaning &amp; Standardization Project: This project involves importing a CSV dataset of company layoffs, removing duplicates, standardizing industry names, dates, and country formats, handling null values, and optimizing the table structure in MySQL. The process is executed through a staged ETL pipeline ensuring data integrity and quality

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing layoff data, specifically related to company layoffs. The goal is to ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and usable for analysis. The data involves various company names, industries, and columns like `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off`. By applying data cleaning techniques, we aim to eliminate duplicates, handle null values, and standardize the naming conventions.

## Key Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, inconsistencies, and unnecessary spaces or characters in the dataset.
- **Data Standardization**: Ensure all company names, industries, and numerical data are standardized for easier analysis.
- **Handling Null Values**: Apply appropriate strategies for dealing with missing or incomplete data.
- **Data Validation**: Confirm that the standardized data meets the project's accuracy requirements.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from multiple sources related to layoffs.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Perform data cleaning operations using SQL and Python.
3. **Standardization**: Standardize names, industries, and other fields for consistency.
4. **Data Validation**: Validate the accuracy and completeness of the cleaned data.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: To query and manipulate the data during cleaning.
- **Python**: For additional data cleaning and validation operations.
- **Pandas**: Used for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Excel**: For initial data organization and structure.

## Future Improvements
- Implement an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to streamline data cleaning.
- Build a dashboard to visualize trends in layoffs over time.
- Incorporate industry-specific insights to understand the impact of layoffs on various sectors.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and ensure you have the required MySQL installed in your device.
